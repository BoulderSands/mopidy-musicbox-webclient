Mopidy Browser Client
*********************

Mopidy is a music server which can play music from `Spotify
<http://www.spotify.com/>`_ or from your local hard drive. 
This is an html/js/css client for Mopidy, which has tighter integration with the server than traditional mpd-clients.

To install Mopidy, check out
`the installation docs <http://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/installation/>`_.

Drop the files from this client in a folder on your Mopidy-system and change the settings.py (of Mopidy) to make it work. See http://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/settings/ for instructions on the settings.
